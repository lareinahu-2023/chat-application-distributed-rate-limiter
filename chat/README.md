# Chat App Example

In this repo,  I build a chat application using Spring Boot, DynamoDB for messages, PostgreSQL for threads, and WebSockets for communication



## Getting Started
```bash
> cd local-dev
> docker compose up -d
> cd ../
> ./gradlew bootRun
```


## Note
This is not a production ready chat app.
